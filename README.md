# README Generator

## Description
This code uses Node the "Inquirer" node package to prompt questions to the user and then generate a formatted README file based on the user's input.

## Test Instructions
To begin, right click the folder containing the "inquiry.js" file and open the terminal. In the terminal, type "node inquiry.js" and follow the on-screen prompts. 
All prompts except for the license prompt will be text inputs. For the license prompt, use the arrows to highlight your choice and press the Enter key to select. When you're done,
it will log "Success!" and your new README.md file will appear in the application folder.
